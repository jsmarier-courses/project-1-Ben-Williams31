<h1>Get to know GGSN!</h1>
    <p>GGSN, or Gee Gee Sports Network to be more specific, is a sports based network which was recently created in 2023 to highlight all sports teams representing the University of Ottawa and spolight different areas of their organisations including their accomplishments, game schedule and results, activities and etc. Our mission with GGSN overall is to highlight all sports teams as much as we can equally and not more in favour of the varsity teams. For decades, varsity clubs and teams have earned tons of recognition and deservidly so through their accomplisments and the attraction it has given to the University. With all the spolight put on the visity however, competitive clubs teams such as women and mens rugby and rowing have struggled to gain recognition from the public despite having numerous playoff appearances, including consecutive national championship apperances in three of the past four years. Although the school puts more time into funding varsity teams instead of club and competitive teams, the GGSN team believes that their accomplishments should not be overlooked by the public and especially by the many students of the university of Ottawa. With this in mind, we thought it would be best update the public on all UOttawa's athletic sports teams as equally as possible through recent news, upcoming events and games, weather they be varsity or recreational. </p>
